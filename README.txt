if you are not a linux user you will not knowing the time tracker 
that called hamster .. then we should give you some hints about what you 
should expect of that app
this app will help you organize your time one activity at a time to give you 
the day full activities list .. so you can extract this list manually into your 
company time sheet or to your excel sheet or whatever the spreed sheet program you like
if you would like to get some history activities you can see what you've done along the previouse days 
by choosing the day you wish from the calender icon in the upper left of the extension 
the good news is you can double click on the stopped task to duplicate it in new activity to avoid wasting time in writing the same task on and on and on.
and the best featur is that you can also edit your activity whenever you like to resume an activity 
so start now and have lots of work with it.. you need it.
